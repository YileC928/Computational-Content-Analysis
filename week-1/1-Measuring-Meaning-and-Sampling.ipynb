Social scientists use content analysis to examine patterns in communication in a replicable and systematic manner.[1] One of the key advantages of using content analysis to analyse social phenomena is its non-invasive nature, in contrast to simulating social experiences or collecting survey answers.\n",

      "Practices and philosophies of content analysis vary between academic disciplines. They all involve systematic reading or observation of texts or artifacts which are assigned labels (sometimes called codes) to indicate the presence of interesting, meaningful pieces of content.[2][3] By systematically labeling the content of a set of texts, researchers can analyse patterns of content quantitatively using statistical methods, or use qualitative methods to analyse meanings of content within texts.\n",

      "Computers are increasingly used in content analysis to automate the labeling (or coding) of documents. Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. Machine learning classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts that can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate. Further, numerous computer-aided text analysis (CATA) computer programs are available that analyze text for pre-determined linguistic, semantic, and psychological characteristics.[4]\n",

What is the social game, social work, or social actors about whom you are seeking to make inferences? What are the virtues of your proposed sample with respect to your research questions? What are its limitations? What are alternatives? What would be a reasonable path to \"scale up\" your sample for further analysis (i.e., high-profile publication)? (<150 words)? [**Note**: your individual or collective project will change over the course of the quarter as new data and/or analysis opportunities arise or if old ones fade away.] "
